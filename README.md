# Tableau-Projects

#### This repository showcases my Tableau projects, demonstrating my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and data storytelling. The projects cover a range of topics, including:
* Data Visualization (interactive dashboards, charts, and maps)
* Business Intelligence (data analysis, reporting, and metrics)
* Data Storytelling (communicating insights and findings through interactive visualizations)

#### Each project includes:
* A brief description of the problem and approach
* Visualizations and dashboards built in Tableau
* Results, including interactive stories and insights

#### My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:
* Connect to various data sources and create interactive visualizations
* Develop effective dashboards to communicate insights and findings
* Extract meaning and value from data through data visualization and storytelling

##### I hope you find my projects informative and inspiring! Explore the projects to see my approach and results.
